# Image_Dewarping_OpenCV

Procedure:
- Input images and calibration images are saved in a directory. The folder is accessed, and
the images are saved in an array.
- Using the cv2 library and functions, the images are dewarped.
- Once the image has been dewarped, the input image (warped) and the output image
(dewarped) are shown side by side to see the difference.
